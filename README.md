## Docker Tagging Strategy

Every CI build on `develop` pushes **two Docker image tags** to Amazon ECR:

- **`dev-latest`** — moving tag that always points to the most recent develop build. ECS services are configured to deploy this tag.
- **`<git-sha>`** — immutable tag using the full 40-character commit SHA, retained for traceability and rollback.

**ECS deployments** reference `dev-latest`. After pushing, the pipeline registers a new ECS task definition with `dev-latest` and forces a new deployment.

**Rollbacks**: to roll back to a previous build, update the ECS task definition to reference the specific `<git-sha>` tag of the desired commit.
